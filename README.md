## About Me
I am a passionate software developer with over 8 years of experience in programming. My expertise spans across **C**, **C++**, **Python**, and **databases**. Throughout my career, I've developed a strong foundation in problem-solving and efficient coding practices.

I believe that continuous learning, self-improvement, and adapting to the ever-evolving tech landscape are essential for personal and professional growth. When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m exploring new programming paradigms, contributing to open-source projects, and always striving to improve myself as a developer. Technology is not just a job for me, but a passion that fuels my curiosity and drives me to learn and grow every day.
